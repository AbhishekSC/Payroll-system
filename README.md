# Payroll & Compensation Platform

## Overview

This project is a backend payroll and compensation system built as part of a technical assessment.

The goal was to design and implement core payroll functionality while demonstrating secure API design,

financial domain awareness, testing practices, and responsible use of AI-assisted development tools.

The system supports:

- Payroll CRUD operations

- Gross-to-net salary calculation

- Payroll anomaly detection

- Secure authentication and authorization

- Admin vs Employee access control

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js

- Express.js

- MongoDB (Mongoose)

- JWT Authentication

- bcrypt for password hashing

- Jest & Supertest for testing

- Postman for manual API testing

---

## Roles & Access Control

### ADMIN

- Register users

- Create, update, delete payrolls

- View all payroll records

- View net salary calculations

- View payroll anomaly reports

### EMPLOYEE

- View only their own payroll

- View net salary breakdown for their payroll

Role-based access is enforced using JWT claims and middleware-level authorization.

Roles & Access Control

ADMIN

	•	Register users
	•	Create, update, delete payrolls
	•	View all payrolls
	•	View net salary calculations

### SAMPLE API USAGE

``` POST /api/payroll

## Create Payroll (ADMIN)

``` 
{
 "employee_id": "EMP004",
 "name": "Aditya Sharma",
 "department": "Engineering",
 "salary": 90000,
 "bonus": 10000,
 "deductions": 4000
}
```

## Net salary calculation

```GET /api/payroll/{payrollId}/net-pay```

```
{
 "gross": 100000,
 "tax": 10000,
 "socialSecurity": 5000,
 "net": 81000
}
```

## Financial Logic
### Net salary is calculated as: 
 ```Gross Salary = Salary + Bonus
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Tax - Social Security - Deductions```

Financial safeguards include:
• No negative salary, bonus, or deductions
• Percentage limits on tax and social security
• Rounding to two decimal places
Financial safeguards include:
• No negative salary, bonus, or deductions
• Percentage limits on tax and social security
• Rounding to two decimal places

## Payroll Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is implemented using explainable, rule-based checks:
• Bonus greater than base salary
• Deductions exceeding 50% of salary
• Negative net salary
• Unusually low salary values
This ensures transparency and auditability.

## Testing
• APIs were first validated manually using Postman.
• Automated integration tests were added using Jest and Supertest.
• Tests cover critical paths:
• Authentication
• Payroll creation
• Role-based access control
• Net salary calculation
• Anomaly detectionTesting

## Run test using:
```npm test```

## Security Considerations
• JWT-based authentication
• Role-based authorization (Admin vs Employee)
• Password hashing using bcrypt
• Input validation for all financial fields
• Employee data isolation
• Immutable business identifiers (employee_id)


# Payroll & Wallet Management System (Backend)
A backend system designed to simulate a **real-world payroll and payout platform**, focusing on **financial correctness, security, auditability, and reliability** rather than simple CRUD operations.
This project demonstrates how payroll calculation, salary payouts, wallets, ledgers, anomaly detection, and idempotent payment handling work together in financial systems.
---
## 🚀 Features Overview
### Payroll
- Payroll CRUD APIs (Admin only)
- Gross-to-net salary calculation
- Payroll anomaly detection
- Explicit payroll payment lifecycle (`paid`, `paidAt`)
- Prevention of duplicate salary payouts
### Wallet & Payments
- One wallet per employee (created lazily)
- Ledger-based transaction system
- Idempotent salary crediting
- Employee wallet balance & transaction history
- Admin audit access to wallet transactions
- Wallet anomaly detection
### Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (ADMIN / EMPLOYEE)
- Strict API access boundaries
---
## 🏗 System Design Principles
- **Ledger-first design** (every balance change has a transaction)
- **Idempotency keys** to prevent duplicate financial operations
- **Separation of concerns** (Payroll ≠ Wallet ≠ Ledger)
- **Defensive validation** for all monetary inputs
- **Auditability by default**
- **Anomaly awareness** instead of silent failures
---
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- Jest (for tests)
- Postman (manual testing)

## 📦 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd payroll-wallet-system


## AI Usage Summary
AI-assisted tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used responsibly to:
• Validate payroll and net salary calculation logic
• Identify financial and security edge cases
• Review JWT authentication and authorization best practices
• Improve controller robustness and defensive programming
• Assist in structuring documentation
All AI-generated suggestions were manually reviewed and intentionally implemented.
Final architectural decisions, testing, and validation were performed by the developer.


## Assessment Alignment
This project demonstrates:
• Code quality, correctness, and completeness
• Secure and scalable backend design
• Financial domain awareness
• Responsible and transparent AI usage
• Clear documentation and testing practices
